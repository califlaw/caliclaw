# caliclaw

Your own personal AI assistant. Any server. Any task. The claw way. 🔱

**The first and only personal AI assistant built for Claude.** No API key — just your subscription.

## Why caliclaw

Other AI assistants (openclaw, etc.) require API keys, manual configuration, and don't support Claude at all. caliclaw is different:

- **Zero config** — `caliclaw start` does everything. Setup, dependencies, pairing — automatic
- **No API key** — runs on your Claude subscription. No tokens, no billing surprises
- **No TOS violations** — built on official tools, not reverse engineering
- **Agents that actually work** — spawn agents on the fly, run them in parallel (swarm), chain them (pipeline), or let them work autonomously (loop) until the task is done
- **They remember** — persistent memory across sessions. Your assistant learns who you are and how you work
- **They have a soul** — personality, rules, and behavior defined in simple markdown files, not buried in code
- **They know when to stop** — anti-hallucination layer, permission levels, human approval for dangerous actions. Type `stop` and everything halts instantly
- **Secure by default** — prompt injection protection, input filtering, and encrypted vault built in. No setup needed
- **They work while you sleep** — cron jobs, scheduled heartbeats, automated checks
- **Smart with your limits** — tracks usage as % of daily limit, auto-downgrades models when you're running hot
- **Sandbox by default** — agents work in isolated workspace. Unleash them on real directories only when you need to: `/unleash ~/myproject`
- **Context follows you** — switch directories with `/unleash`, conversation context is preserved automatically. One assistant, infinite places to work

## Quick start

**From PyPI:**

```bash
pip install caliclaw
caliclaw start
```

**From source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/califlaw/caliclaw.git
cd caliclaw
source install.sh
caliclaw start
```

First run triggers setup automatically. Pair with your bot by sending `/pair <code>` in Telegram.

No YAML configs. No Docker. No environment variables to hunt down.

Need to change something later? Use `caliclaw reforge` to pick one component
(credentials, profile, soul, model, or skills) and re-configure it without
touching the rest.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated
- Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

## How agents work

> When you kill an agent, it doesn't just die — it extracts everything it learned into memory. The next agent picks up where it left off. Knowledge never dies.

```
You send a message in Telegram
  -> caliclaw loads the agent's soul, memory, and skills
  -> Agent processes your request with full system access
  -> Response streams back to Telegram in real-time
  -> Conversation saved, memory updated

Need parallel work?
  -> /spawn researcher "find all bugs in auth module"
  -> /spawn fixer "fix the bugs researcher found"
  -> They work independently, report back to you

Need autonomous work?
  -> /loop "refactor the entire test suite"
  -> Agent works in iterations until done or you say stop

Need scheduled work?
  -> /cron "0 9 * * *" "check server health and report"
  -> Runs every morning, sends you the result
```

Built your own skill and want to share it? Fork [caliclaw-gym](https://github.com/califlaw/caliclaw-gym), add `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, open a PR. After merge it gets a voting issue — community upvotes with 👍 and it ranks by stars. See the [contributing guide](https://github.com/califlaw/caliclaw-gym/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

No API, no backend, no auth — just GitHub Issues for voting and GitHub Pages for the browser. Zero infrastructure, fully community-owned.

## Choosing the model

By default caliclaw uses `sonnet` — balanced between speed and reasoning. Change it anytime:

```bash
caliclaw model                    # show current default + options
caliclaw model set opus           # switch to opus (more reasoning, heavier)
caliclaw model set haiku          # switch to haiku (fast, cheap)
```

The CLI persists your choice in `.env` and auto-restarts the bot if it's running. You can also switch runtime-only via `/model` in Telegram.

## Migration

Coming from another *claw project?

```bash
caliclaw migrate ~/path/to/old-project
```

Auto-detects project type. Migrates soul, memory, skills, database. Supports openclaw, nanoclaw, zeroclaw.

## Deploy

```bash
ssh user@vps
pip install caliclaw
caliclaw start
```

Auto-reconnects on network drops. Auto-restarts on failure. Graceful shutdown with watchdog.

### Make it immortal ☠

Survive reboots, crashes, OOM kills — caliclaw comes back every time:

```bash
caliclaw immortal on       # installs systemd unit, enables, starts
caliclaw immortal          # status — alive/dead, immortal/mortal
caliclaw immortal off      # break the seal
```

During first-run `caliclaw init`, the "Keep caliclaw always running" option does the same thing. You can toggle it later anytime with `caliclaw immortal on/off` — no need to re-run init.

Status output looks like:

```
  ☠  IMMORTAL  survives reboots and crashes
  ♥  Alive right now
```
